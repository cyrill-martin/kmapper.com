After the first phase you will know the strategy and goals of your project. Together, we will develop the appropriate architecture to present and share your data and information: 

- based on your strategy and goals 
- adapted to the needs of your users 
- taking into account the organizational and technical feasibility 
- comprehensively documented 

With the developed architecture, you move to the next project phase.
