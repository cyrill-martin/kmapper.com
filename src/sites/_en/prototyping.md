Based on your data and information architecture, you will receive a working prototype application to validate your concept and iteratively adapt it: 

- securely hosted in the cloud
- accessible via browser, no own infrastructure required
- based on live or test data
- comprehensively documented

With the validated prototype, you move to the next project phase.
