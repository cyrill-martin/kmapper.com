h3-principles: Principles

p-1-principles: kmapper advocated short development cycles and is based on the principles of <b>Feedback</b>, <b>Simplicity</b>, and <b>Change</b>.

h4-feedback: Feedback

p-1-feedback: Having contact with you in more frequent iterations, you get a clear insight into what is being developed. You can give feedback and steer the development as needed.

p-2-feedback: Concise documentation of each iteration and written feedback avoids costly meetings.

h4-simplicity: Simplicity

p-1-simplicity: Starting from the simplest solution, a system takes into account the current requirements.

p-2-simplicity: With many little steps made, you have more control over the development process and the system being developed.

h4-change: Change

p-1-change: As a problem is better understood, your requirements might change.

p-2-change: Changes are embraced and new requirements are planned for the next iteration.
